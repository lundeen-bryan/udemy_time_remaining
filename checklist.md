### Extension Development Checklist:

1. **Code & Features**:
   - [x] Refactor and improve the Udemy time calculator script (`udemyTimeCalculator.js`).
   - [x] Implement popup scripting (`popup.js`).
   - [x] Set up styles for the popup (`popup.css`).
   - [x] Review and modify the manifest file (`manifest.json`).
   - [x] Review the popup interface (`popup.html`).
   - [x] Review the popup interface (`popup.js`).
   - [x] Review the popup interface (`popup.css`).

2. **Assets**:
   - [x] Keep generic icons (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128).
   - [x] Use `twitter.png` (32x32) for the Twitter sharing button in the popup.

3. **Background Script**:
   - [x] Decide on whether to retain, modify, or discard the `background.js` file. If retaining, potentially integrate the code from `udemyTimeCalculator.js` for consistency.

4. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Set up a GitHub repository
   - [ ] Create a well-designed README.md detailing the extension, its purpose, how to install and use, etc.
   - [ ] Create a CHANGELOG.md to record and track changes made throughout the project's life.

5. **Testing & QA**:
   - [ ] Set up a local testing environment with Edge as the primary target platform.
   - [ ] Test the extension thoroughly on Edge.
   - [ ] Test on other browsers like Brave and Chrome to ensure compatibility.
   - [ ] Develop a set of test cases/scenarios to ensure full coverage of the extension's features.
   - [ ] Check the responsiveness and functionality of the popup, especially the Twitter sharing feature.

   - [ ] Share the project with a select group of users for beta testing and feedback.

6. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - [ ] Address any issues discovered during cross-browser testing.
   - [ ] Implement any necessary fixes or adjustments to ensure cross-browser functionality.

7. **Performance**:
   - [ ] Evaluate the extension's performance, ensuring it does not slow down the browser or pages.
   - [ ] Optimize any areas of the code that could be more efficient.

8. **Feedback & Continuous Improvement**:
   - [ ] Gather user feedback from the beta testing phase.
   - [ ] Iteratively improve the extension based on feedback and changing needs or technologies.

9. **Deployment**:
   - [ ] Prepare all assets and codes for deployment.
   - [ ] Submit the extension to the Chrome Web Store.
